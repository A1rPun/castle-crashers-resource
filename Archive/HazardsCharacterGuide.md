- [Original link](http://forums.thebehemoth.com/topic/17862-hazards-castle-crashers-character-guide/)

This guide will show how to unlock every character in the game, as well as show how to fully utilize every character.

Note - I also have a Good for Insane Mode? for each character.  No is characters that are simply bad, Yes is characters that can hold their own but do not make the mode a joke, Definitely are top tier characters, and Easily are the OP characters that make Insane a joke. Depends are characters that are good, depending on the circumstances that the player is in.



1/31 - Green Knight

How to Unlock - Default

Element - Poison

Starting Weapon - Thin Sword

Best Strategy - Green Knight is a character that can Poison its enemies, and then start combo'ing it to do physical damage while your magic hurts it.

Good for Insane Mode? - Depends



As one of the four Default Knights, the Green Knight is very popular.  However, it is the least played out of the four original knights.  It has good Magic, [Less upfront damage, but 3x DoT from the poison] but it is considered one of the worst character in the game due to a unique YY attack.  To many people this does not matter at all, but this makes the best juggle combo [XXYY] impossible to do with this character.  However, the Green Knight does have the best magic for killing bosses and beefies out of the four Default Knights This does not matter at all if you are just playing through the game for your first time, and this is a good choice.



2/31 - Red Knight

How to Unlock - Default

Element - Electricity

Starting Weapon - Mace

Best Strategy - Using the Red Knight's stun-locking splash is the way to go. Run away from enemies to get to one side of the screen, and then electrocute all of them.  Once the magic runs out, dodge hits until the magic bar recharges and repeat.

Good for Insane Mode? - Easily



For six years, all that people said was 'Red Knight is OP' and 'Nerf the Red Knight'.  All of a sudden, people started saying 'Buff the Red Knight' and 'The Red Knight is horrible'. There was never an update/nerf and the Red Knight is still as amazing as it always was. There is a minor learning curve to this character, but with a little bit of time it is one of the best.



3/31 - Blue Knight

How to Unlock - Default

Element - Ice

Starting Weapon - Sheathed Sword

Best Strategy - It doesn't matter.  Anything works.

Good for Insane Mode? - Easily



Blue Knight is easily the best character in the entire game; it's not even close.  Any strategy works with this character, as it can kill enemies on insane mode without even letting them move.  The only downside is that it is very overplayed; there is a 95% chance that someone will pick the Blue Knight before you in a random match. Choosing this character makes the game very easy.



4/31 - Orange Knight

How to Unlock - Default

Element - Fire

Starting Weapon - Broad Ax

Best Strategy - Stay long-range; it has a long distance splash attack for a reason.

Good for Insane Mode? - Yes



Magic-wise, this is the worst of the four Default Knights.  In spite of this, it is also the most played as character in multiplayer.  It has a Fire DoT [1x] on every single attack; but the 1x DoT does not make up for the lack in initial damage.  It has one of the longest range attacks, so it is a good ranged fighter.  Also, it has the 3rd best crowd control in the game, only being surpassed by Blue and Iceskimo. While it is not a bad character, I do not recommend initially using the Orange Knight, save it for a later playthrough.



5/31 - Royal Guard

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Green Knight

Element - Non-Elemental ; Bombs

Starting Weapon - Falchion

Best Strategy - Stay in the air as much as possible, dropping bombs on enemies from above.

Good for Insane Mode? - Definitely



The Royal Guard is a would-be 'Arrow Knight', but the Bombs save it from this fate.  The Bombs are the best magic projectile/magic slant in the entire game.  They have insane damage and knockback, alongside a Fire DoT.  It has a relatively worthless Splash, but the Bombs alone make it one of the better characters in the game.



6/31 - Saracen

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Royal Guard

Element - Non-Elemental ; Tornado[Sand]

Starting Weapon - Falchion

Best Strategy - Use the 'TurtleNado' combo.  (AA + Magic Slant)  This combo grants invulnerability to physical damage while in the tornado.

Good for Insane Mode? - Yes



The Saracen is a very unique character.  It has a very unorthodox Splash and Slant, having it be a tornado instead of a normal splash.  As stated above, using TurtleNado is the best use of said tornado.  Saracen has even more unique moves.  The 'magic projectile' is a Sand Gust, which knocks over all enemies in the way of it.  This sets up an easy tornado or melee combo.



7/31 - Skeleton

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Red Knight

Element - Non-Elemental ; Dark

Starting Weapon - Skeletor Mace

Best Strategy - As a relatively all-around basic character, it can do pretty much anything, it just does not stand out. If anything, it stands out in boss slaying.

Good for Insane Mode? - Yes



The Skeleton is a very average character, but it has no noticeable cons.  It has very small bonuses that add up to make a good jack of all trades. The pillar magic is especially helpful for setting up a good combo.



8/31 - Bear

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Skeleton

Element - Non-Elemental ; Tornado[Wind]

Starting Weapon - Wooden Club

Best Strategy - Use the 'TurtleNado' combo.  (AA + Magic Slant)  This combo grants invulnerability to physical damage while in the tornado.

Good for Insane Mode? - Yes



The Bear and Saracen are almost completely identical.  The only difference between the two of them is that the Bear has an average magic projectile, and nothing super unique like the Saracen's gust.

9/31 - Industrialist

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Blue Knight

Element - Non-Elemental ; Mechanical

Starting Weapon - Ugly Mace

Best Strategy - Industrialist is one of the best characters in the game. It and Fencer can kill bosses faster than anything else.

Good for Insane Mode? - Easily



The Industrialist does stand out in boss destruction, but it is also good against enemies. The sheer number of hits from the splash destroy beefies and knocks all small enemies out of the way.



10/31 - Fencer

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Industrialist

Element - Non-Elemental ; Mechanical

Starting Weapon - Fencer's Foil

Best Strategy - Fencer is one of the best characters in the game. It and Industrialist can kill bosses faster than anything else.

Good for Insane Mode? - Easily



The Fencer does stand out in boss destruction, but it is also good against enemies.  The sheer number of hits from the splash destroy beefies and knocks all small enemies out of the way.



11/31 - Fire Demon

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Orange Knight

Element - Fire

Starting Weapon - Black MorningStar

Best Strategy - The Fire Demon is a jack of all trades. It can do anything needed well, and as a result is a great character.

Good for Insane Mode? - Definitely



The Fire Demon is like a Skeleton on roids + Fire DoT.. It's amazing in every way.



12/31 - Ninja

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Fire Demon

Element - Non-Elemental ; Stealth

Starting Weapon - Sai

Best Strategy - The Ninja is good for killing bosses due to the condensed splash magic's hitboxes.

Good for Insane Mode? - Yes



The Ninja is a relatively basic character that has a short range on it's splash. However, instead of being screwed over by this, the Ninja has the same number of hits; the hitboxes are all just condensed.  This makes it amazing for killing bosses and beefies



13/31 - Gray Knight

How to Unlock - Beat the Barbarian Boss

Element - Non-Elemental ; Bombs + Normal

Starting Weapon - Skinny Sword

Best Strategy - Rain down bombs on enemies from the sky.

Good for Insane Mode? - Yes



The Gray Knight is a worse version of the Royal Guard/Conehead.  They are identical except for the fact that the Gray Knight is tied with the Red Knight for worst XXXY in the game. However, this is still a good character.



14/31 - Stove Face

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Gray Knight

Element - Non-Elemental ; Basic

Starting Weapon - Gladiator Sword

Best Strategy - See the Thief.

Good for Insane Mode? - No



This is one of the 5 'Arrow Clones'.  Find the Thief's section for the detailed explanation.



15/31 - Barbarian

How to Unlock - Beat the King's Arena

Element - Non-Elemental ; Weaponry

Starting Weapon - Barbarian Ax

Best Strategy - Stay close medium range, as the Barbarian's splash can hit from both directions.

Good for Insane Mode? - Yes



'Decent at everything, amazing at nothing'.  That is the motto of the Barbarian.  It is very overlooked and considered an Arrow Clone.  That is not true, as it has a unique splash; it hits from two sides, causing it to be effective at killing bosses and beefies.



16/31 - Killer Beekeeper

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Barbarian

Element - BEES

Starting Weapon - Rat Bee-Ting Bat

Best Strategy - It can hit enemies in the air, and it has a fast projectile.

Good for Insane Mode? - Yes



The Killer Beekeeper is the most underrated character in the entire game!  It is disappointing seeing how nobody at all plays as it online.  It really is a good character, and people need to play as it.  People say that it is a reskinned Arrow Clone, which is completely not true. It does more damage than arrows, moves faster than arrows, has less/no delay, and its 'Arrows' are freaking Bees!  It is a much better character then it is made out to be (worse than arrow clones) This character needs to be played more online; I encourage anyone who has the Beekeeper unlocked to use it in random matches. If you don't have it unlocked, unlock it. The Beekeeper is the rightful king of Castle Crashers, and will be making its rise soon. Beekeeper2k15.



P.S. - BEES

17/31 - Thief

How to Unlock - Beat the Thieves' Arena

Element - Non-Elemental ; Basic

Starting Weapon - Thieves' Sword

Best Strategy - Use RT+Y at a distance to compensate for the delayed splash or spellweave while flying.

Good for Insane Mode? - No



The Thief is the 'original' of the 5 Arrow Clones.  These are some of the worst characters in the entire game due to average attacks and a bad splash.  Using these characters makes the game hard.



18/31 - Snakey

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Thief

Element - Non-Elemental ; Nature

Starting Weapon - Snakey Mace

Best Strategy - Snakey is a jack of all trades character, even though it is good at killing bosses

Good for Insane Mode? - Definitely



While Snakey and Fire Demon's magics look completely different, the perform identically. The only difference is the Fire Demon has a fire DoT and Snakey has more immediate damage.



19/31 - Conehead

How to Unlock - Beat the Volcano Arena

Element - Non-Elemental ; Bombs

Starting Weapon - Lightsaber

Best Strategy - Stay in the air as much as possible, dropping bombs on enemies from above.

Good for Insane Mode? - Definitely



The Conehead is a would-be 'Arrow Knight', but the Bombs save it from this fate.  The Bombs are the best magic projectile/magic slant in the entire game.  They have insane damage and knockback, alongside a Fire DoT.  It has a relatively worthless Splash, but the Bombs alone make it one of the better characters in the game.


20/31 - Peasant

How to Unlock - Beat the Peasant Arena

Element - Non-Elemental ; Basic

Starting Weapon - Wooden Sword

Best Strategy - See the Thief.

Good for Insane Mode? - No



This is one of the 5 'Arrow Clones'.  Find the Thief's section for the detailed explanation.


21/31 - Civilian

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Peasant

Element - Non-Elemental ; Basic

Starting Weapon - Pitchfork

Best Strategy - See the Thief.

Good for Insane Mode? - No



This is one of the 5 'Arrow Clones'.  Find the Thief's section for the detailed explanation.


22/31 - Iceskimo

How to Unlock - Beat the Icy Arena

Element - Non-Elemental Hybrid ; Ice

Starting Weapon - Fishing Spear

Best Strategy - XXXY Freezelocking makes Insane mode easy.

Good for Insane Mode? - Easily



This character is a poor man's Blue Knight, but it is still one of the very best characters in the game.  It can permanently freeze enemies by constantly using the XXXY combo.  This is easily one of the best characters.


23/31 - Brute

How to Unlock - Beat the game as Iceskimo

Element - Non-Elemental ; Nature

Starting Weapon - Dual-Pronged Sword

Best Strategy - Brute is a jack of all trades character, even though it is good at killing bosses

Good for Insane Mode? - Definitely



While Brute and Fire Demon's magics look completely different, the perform identically. The only difference is the Fire Demon has a fire DoT and Brute has more immediate damage.


24/31 - Alien Hominid

How to Unlock - XBOX: Get one achievement in Alien Hominid HD  PS3: Beat Alien Ship on Insane Mode

Element - Non-Elemental Hybrid ; Fire

Starting Weapon - Alien Gun

Best Strategy - Run away from enemies and spam your RT+Y whenever magic is full.

Good for Insane Mode? - No

Alien Hominid is one of the worst characters in the game, but it is still very fun to use in normal mode.  It has the worst RT+B in the entire game, and a bad XXXY.  Also, it cannot switch weapons; it's stuck with the Alien Gun. It's RT+Y is good for normal enemies and beefies, but bad for bosses. Despite it being a bad character, it is fun and interesting to use.

25/31 - King

How to Unlock - XBOX: Buy the King Pack DLC  Steam/PS: Beat Pipistrello's Cave on Insane Mode
Element - Non-Elemental ; Healing
Starting Weapon - King's Scepter
Best Strategy - Heal in between waves, use the projectile or slant as your main attack
Good for Insane Mode? - Depends

In single-player, King is one of the worst characters in the game.  However, the King is a must have on multiplayer; especially Insane Mode.  The King has no splash attack. In place of a splash attack, the King has a healing power.  This means that on multiplayer, the King can fully heal every single player at once.

26/31 - Open-Face Gray Knight

How to Unlock - XBOX: Buy the King Pack DLC  Steam/PS: Beat Catfish on Insane Mode
Element - Non-Elemental ; Basic
Starting Weapon - Skinny Sword
Best Strategy - See the Thief.

Good for Insane Mode? - No



This is one of the 5 'Arrow Clones'.  Find the Thief's section for the detailed explanation. One bonus to using the Open-Face Gray Knight is that you are almost 100% guaranteed to be able to use it in multiplayer; nobody ever uses this character.



27/31 - Necromancer

How to Unlock - XBOX: Buy the Necromantic DLC  Steam/PS: Beat Industrial Castle on Insane Mode

Element - Non-Elemental ; Death

Starting Weapon - Necromancer's Sword

Best Strategy - Stay long range in all fights.

Good for Insane Mode? - Yes



The Necromancer is tied for having the longest range splash in the game alongside the Pink Knight.  Instead of having more hits available, it expands all of the original hit boxes. This makes it relatively useless against bosses.  However, it also has the 3rd best and fastest projectile in the game, following Bombs and Blue Knight's icicle.  From far away, Necromancer can overwhelm enemies.



28/31 - Cultist

How to Unlock - XBOX: Buy the Necromantic DLC  Steam/PS: Beat Ice Castle on Insane Mode

Element - Non-Elemental ; Dark

Starting Weapon - Glowstick

Best Strategy - As a relatively all-around basic character, it can do pretty much anything, it just does not stand out. If anything, it stands out in boss slaying.

Good for Insane Mode? - Yes



The Cultist is a very average character, but it has no noticeable cons.  It has very small bonuses that add up to make a good jack of all trades. The pillar magic is especially helpful for setting up a good combo.



29/31 - Pink Knight

How to Unlock - Remastered: Default Character  360, PS, Steam: Download the Pink Knight Pack DLC

Element - Non-Elemental

Starting Weapon - Lollipop

Best Strategy - Use your critical hit bombs, preferably from the sky

Good for Insane Mode? - Definitely



Pink Knight is a mashup of multiple characters.  It has the splash length of the Necromancer's (More hitboxes, not expanded) and it freezes (although shorter) like the Blue Knight's magic.  It's projectiles are makeshift bombs; while they can't blow up cracked walls, they can do critical hits on enemies.  Pink Knight is very strange, but it is also one of the best characters in the game.



30/31 - The Blacksmith

How to Unlock - Buy the Legend of The Blacksmith DLC

Element - Non-Elemental Hybrid ; Smithing and Fire

Starting Weapon - The Blacksmith's Hammer

Best Strategy - Stay away from enemies and use your projectile

Good for Insane Mode? - No



The Blacksmith is not a very good character.  It has a short range, low quality splash. However, it has a very good projectile.  Its projectile has normal initial damage and a fire DoT.



31/31 - Hatty Hattington

How to Unlock - Buy the Can't Stop Crying 'DLC' (The DLC is automatically downloaded after getting an achievement on BattleBlock Theater)

Element - Non-Elemental; $$$

Starting Weapon - Gem Sword

Best Strategy - Use its slant - a makeshift, worse version of a bomb.

Good for Insane Mode? - NO!!!



Hatty Hattington is the most overused, overrated character in the entire game.  It is horrible; if you try to use its splash on the later half of insane, you will probably die.  Its splash has a delay of over 3 seconds.  Its slant is its only saving grace, but even the slant is a poor man's version of a actually good one.  Do not play as Hatty because  1) It is horrible and makes the game much harder than it should be.. and  2) In almost every single multiplayer lobby, someone will be playing as Hatty; it is always a race to choose Hatty for some reason. There are 30 characters in this game that are better than Hatty, and you should save your playthrough as this character for very far down the road playing this game.
