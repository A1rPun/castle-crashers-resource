# Hazard's Castle Crashers Animal Orb Guide

- [Original link](http://forums.thebehemoth.com/topic/17844-hazards-castle-crashers-animal-orb-guide/)

I have been making many guides as of late to help new players get ready for the re-master.  This guide will focus on the locations of (in order of availability), the effects, and what are the best animal orbs in the game [Covered in posts 7-9] .

Note - When playing in multiplayer, most animal orbs will not appear if another player has it following them (Ex - If Player B has Scratchpaw with them and Player A goes to the level where it  is hidden to find it, it won't be there).



1/29 - Sherbert

Effect - Gives you a higher jump



Location - This is the first pet in the game.  After you finish Home Castle and Castle Keep, go to the Blacksmith level.  Enter the Animal Ark and go all the way to the left of the screen (to the locked door).  If you look at the top left of your screen, you can see it hiding on the ceiling.  Jump and combo the X and Y buttons.  Alternatively, you can use the Magic Jump [RT+A] (20 points in magic required) and simply jump from the ground to it.





2/29 - Owlet

Effect - Finds hidden food in trees



Location - At the very end of the Forest Entrance, right before entering the Thieves' Forest, look for musical notes coming from behind the plants (near the top of the screen). Walk past/behind the plants to find the hidden Owlet.





3/29 - Seahorse

Effect - Move at normal speed through areas with water



Location - In the Thieves' Forest, it is sitting in plain sight.  Right after the cutscene with Poop Deer, there is a wave of enemies at the shallow river. Seahorse is sitting at the top of the screen, on the right side of the river.





4/29 - Troll

Effect - Restores 1% of your HP every 8 seconds



Location - Return to the Thieves' Forest after you purchase Bombs. Right before the wall that you have to destroy in the ruins-esque area, you can see it through a cracked wall at the top of the screen. Use 3 Bombs on the cracked wall to open a passageway to the Troll.





5/29 - Rammy

Effect - Knocks over enemies (or friends in PvP)  It can do either a charge up attack, or be dragged through the enemy



Location - You will see Rammy following the Bear Boss in Tall Grass Field. Once you defeat the boss, you can pick up Rammy as your own animal orb.

6/29 - Bitey Bat


Effect - Holds a single enemy in place and does a little damage to it

7/29 - Meowburt


Effect - +3 Agility

Immediately after entering the cave, exit out of it to the left, the way you came in. Meowburt will be waiting for you in plain sight.





8/29 - Snoot


Effect - +2 Strength

12/29 - Burly Bear


Effect - +2 Strength



Location - Return to Tall Grass Field after you have Bombs and Sandwiches. Right before you climb up the cliff, use a sandwich to throw the huge boulder out of the way.  Go inside the hidden cave that is revealed.  There is a smaller, cracked boulder on the northern wall.  Blow up this boulder with bombs and go inside the gap.  Walk to the right in this gap to pick up Burly Bear.





13/29 - Giraffey


Effect - x1.1 EXP Boost

Hazard's Pet Tiers



Amazing (S - Tier)



1. Scratchpaw - Scratchpaw increases the two most important stats for Insane Mode, and it should definitely be used after reaching Level 99 (Or any other desired level). On top of that, when combining this and the Snakey Mace, the stat bonuses equate to +6 Strength, +5 Magic, and +5 Agility; all it sacrifices is 3 Defense.



AND



   Hawkster - Hawkster is one of the most used pets in the game.  It is very good and is easily one of the best pets; it gives a exp boost similar to Giraffey. The extra food it gives makes surviving much easier if you get hit constantly.



3. Piggy - Piggy is very similar to Hawkster, but it typically overshadowed.  It is only the very best pet for the Necrosane fight, but it is a valuable part for any 4 or 2 player team.



4. Monkeyface - Monkeyface combined with Piggy and Hawkster makes a 3-Headed monster for any group.  It makes food drops very common, and with the second food from Hawkster, all of the players would have trouble dying.



5. Giraffey - Giraffey makes you level up faster.  Quite obviously, this makes it amazing.  Personally, I used this pet 100% of the time from level 1 to level 99 on every character.  However, it loses all purpose once your level is maxed.





Great (A - Tier)



6. BiPolar Bear - This popular pet is absolute garbage.  People think 'Wow it kills bosses at low health, and it prevents overkill on enemies?  That sounds great!'  In reality, it murders you on Insane Mode more often than the enemies themselves do. I remember one time was playing with a cousin using this for the Necrosane fight, and it killed us both after the 2nd wave.  Nobody should get killed by something that is supposed to help them.  However, despite all this, it does deserve to be this high. It saves at least a few minutes on every boss fight.  Don't use it outside of boss stages though.



7. Snoot & Burly Bear - These two are identical, and they are both pretty good.  +2 Strength is always helpful to have, and it will make your Insane Mode troubles much easier.



9. Meowburt - +3 Agility is helpful, plain and simple.  It helps your dodging ability and arrow damage immensely.



10. Chicken - The Chicken seems great on paper, but it would be better if it focused its bonuses into one stat.

Good (B - Tier)

11. Spiny - +2 Defense is less helpful than Agility or Strength, but it has its niche.

12. Bitey Bat - This pet is nice for starting juggles and temporarily freezing enemies.



13. Yeti & Rammy - These are the two best arena pets (Block Blue and Red knight spammers, respectively), but the arena is only one part of the game.  They are relatively useless outside of that.



15. Beholder - Magic is the worst stat, so the magic boosting pet is the least helpful out of them.





Ok (C - Tier)



16. Troll - If you have enough patience, you can regenerate to full health after every single wave of enemies.  It just doesn't heal enough to be amazing.



17. Owlet & Zebra - It isn't often that you find trees or grass, but when you do, it's a nice health boost.



19. Pazzo & Cardinal - Use each of these two all the way through a play-through, but don't use them anymore later because they become worthless after getting everything they offer.

Bad (D - Tier)



21. Frogglet - It picks up items when you get it lined up with the item, and it brings them to you.  However, they can be intercepted and they don't find anything extra.



22. Seahorse - It is helpful for the River Rapids and Flooded Temple, nothing more than that.



23. Golden Whale - It's nice to be AFK having the whale aiming at you to get free money if you are away for a few hours.  It's not good though if you are actually playing.



24. Mr. Buddy - It's good in Treasure Arena, nothing else.



25. Snailburt - This is the first Animal Orb that does more harm than good.  It is above the others because it actually has a good use at one point.  It's +5 Defense is amazing when you have no points in agility.





Horrible (F - Tier)



26. Sherbert - This one makes juggles harder to start because of the awkward high jump.  It is very hard, but it is possible to use.



27. InstallBall, Pelter & Dragonhead - These three don't attack often, but when they do, they mess something up.  Usually in your juggles, these 3 knock enemies out of your juggle.
