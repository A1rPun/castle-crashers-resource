Level Required : 20

Unlocked via - Bear (Rare drop or Unlock)

Good for Insane Mode ? - Easily ; Outclassed by Chainsaw

Hazard's note - One of the best weapons in the game, and many people think it is the best. If the agility subtraction was less, it would be the best in the game.  The agility is a huge problem for many pros, which is why it is not #1.  IF you can get past the agility deficit, it is great.



26/84 - Ugly Mace

Stats : -2 Magic, +6 Defense ; 1% Critical Hit Chance

Level Required : 20

Unlocked via - Industrialist (Rare drop or Unlock)

Good for Insane Mode ? - Yes

Level Required : 5

Unlocked via - Tall Grass Field (Inside a cavern; use a sandwich on boulder before cliff)

Good for Insane Mode ? - No





29/84 - Wrapped Sword

Stats : -1 Strength, +1 Magic, +1 Defense

Level Required : 1

Unlocked via - Thieves' Forest (Hidden behind a pillar right before the breakable wall)

Good for Insane Mode ? - No



30/84 - Skeletor Mace

Stats : -2 Strength, +3 Defense, +6 Agility

Level Required : 20

Unlocked via - Skeleton (Rare drop or Unlock)

Good for Insane Mode ? - Easily

Hazard's Note - This is the Ultimate arrow spammer's weapon.  IMO this is a horrible tactic, but many people do it.



31/84 - Clunky Mace

Stats : +5 Strength, -2 Agility

Level Required : 10

Unlocked via - Volcano Store (340 Coins)

Good for Insane Mode ? - Arguably



32/84 - Snakey Mace

Stats : +5 Magic, -2 Defense, +3 Agility ; 2% Critical Hit Chance

Level Required : 20

Unlocked via - Snakey (Rare drop or Unlock)

Good for Insane Mode ? - Best Weapon in the Game

Hazard's Note - Negative defense does not matter at all on insane mode,  your health stays the same, and the damage that enemies do barely change (number of hits to die doesn't change from any enemy while holding it)  The +3 Agility increases arrow damage, which is nice for killing enemies in a pinch.  The +5 magic is very helpful for boss killing, but more importantly something explained soon.  The 2% critical hit translates to +5 strength.  With the magic boost, it creates the most powerful Elemental Combo possible.  Using one of those and getting a critical causes 864 damage.



33/84 - Rat-Bee-ting Bat

Stats : +2 Strength, +1 Defense

Level Required : 10

Unlocked via - Beekeeper (Rare drop or Unlock)

Good for Insane Mode ? - No



34/84 - Black Morningstar

Stats : -3 Strength, +6 Magic, +1 Defense ; 1% Critical Hit Chance

Level Required : 20

Unlocked via - Fire Demon (Rare drop or Unlock)

Good for Insane Mode ? - Easily

Hazard's Note - Magic is relatively useless on Insane if strength is subtracted, but this is the best magic weapon in the game.



35/84 - King's Scepter

Stats : +3 Strength, +2 Magic, +3 Defense

Level Required : 20

Unlocked via - King's DLC or let the King die on insane mode FloweryField (Don't attack)

Good for Insane Mode ? - Yes

Hazard's Note - Overall good weapon; nothing special about it.
