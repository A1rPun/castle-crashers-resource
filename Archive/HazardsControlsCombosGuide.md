- In Industrial Castle you can grind XP very fast by using the Boomerang on the boss's pillars.

- In Home Castle you can skip half of the level by flying into the door while the cutscene is playing.

- In Industrial castle you can skip (not timewise) the very last cutscene. Done by flying into the telescope after the second to last cutscene ends. Walk to the left when it happens.

- Hold block at the end (just behind the well) of Wizard Castle Takeoff (requires multiple players because 1 player need to trigger the cutscene)

- Full Moon ladder glitch
