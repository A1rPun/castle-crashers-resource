## OOB locations

- On the slanted stairs you can do the revive trick
- TAG's spot, hard to describe

## Fishman AI manipulation

In the first wave you can get the 3 fishman stuck in a specific spot.
This spot is at the top of the level where the water section starts.
Walk into the water section, do some splashes at the top to let the fishman jump so you can move to the left.

It's useful to setup the chicken at the start of the level to get infinite magic by having 2 animal orbs on top of each other. You can even bring the infinite magic all the way to the medusa fight.

### Fishman necro splash

Doing the above manipulation with necromancer with the right rhythm makes it so the fishman don't jump into the air.

## Fishman stuck

1. Position a fishman on a slanted slope, there are 2 small stairs in the level
2. It's easier to face right and have the fishmen standing right of you
3. Do 2 light attacks against the fishman
4. Then jump and do 2 heavy attacks
5. When the fishman is coming down hit it just above the ground to get it stuck

Get it unstuck by H-dashing into it or use a beefy and hit it.

## Fishman OOB

In the 2 last enemy waves you can get both fishman stuck in OOB.
When the fishman are walking down the stairs you need to hit them on the stairs so they jump out of bounds.
Best done with a L-dash and one more hit or splash attacks.

## Waterwalking glitch

This can happen randomly by having the (in)correct position or by getting OOB and walking into the water instead of OOB.

## Boss strategy

Drill combo, splash, block & repeat. Also keep moving into medusa.
When playing with multiple players you want to be on the same position, for example at the top of the map.

## Stoned in the air

When medusa is in her stare phase, face right and gaze into her stare while being airborne.
This makes it so you get stoned, but you're not in the air just yet.
Let medusa make contact with you and you'll get into the air.
