## <a name="cutscene"></a>Cutscene OoB glitch

*TODO: insert image*

- Stand behind the destroyed well while another player starts the cutscene.

Equip the boomerang and when you are about to land hold U and right to exit the level before you land. In specific cases (player number) you want to move down a little too.
