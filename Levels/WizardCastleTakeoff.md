## <a name="cutscene"></a>Cutscene OOB glitch

*TODO: insert image*

- Hold block before the cutscene starts and you will be OOB after the cutscene.
or
- Stand behind the destroyed well while another player starts the cutscene.

## <a name="cutscene-reversed"></a>Cutscene reversed FX

*TODO: need more testing*

Look to the left when starting the cutscene.

## <a name="fastexit"></a>Fast exit with boomerang

Equip the boomerang and when you are about to land hold U and right to exit the level before you land. In specific cases (player number) you want to move down a little too.

There is also an alternative way, press H and hold right when you are able to land. When landed press J and hold U and right.
