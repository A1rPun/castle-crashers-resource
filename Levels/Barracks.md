## <a name="money-glitch"></a>AFK money glitch

Equip a golden whale, optimally you'll need 4 golden whales.
Go to the digspot where Mr. Buddy is, position youself so that you look to the right.
Equip the shovel and start to dig. You will now pick up gold without giving any input.

## <a name="oob"></a>OOB locations

Die on the sloped area next to the door, do this by one player getting himself killed by BiPolar while on low health. Revive this player while standing on flat ground. The revived player can now walk out of bounds.

After the credits you can just use a sandwich to get the other player OOB. Grab him whilst in beefy form and walk to a spot where the other player hangs outside of the level. For example the door on the right. Wait till the beefy timer is done and the other player is OOB. Because teleports are on the other player needs to use a sandwich immidiately and grab the player that is standing in bounds. When succesfully executed both players will be OOB.

## <a name="headless"></a>Headless

After the credits there is a good place to setup the headless glitch. The player that gets headless needs to stand behind the princess next to the fruit. Make sure a fruit is spawned and no player is getting it. Another player needs to decapitate that player by tapping L.

Having a crit weapon may interfere with this glitch.
Having BiPolar as a pet will interfere with this glitch.

## <a name="rubber-handle"></a>Rubber-Handle

This infamous sword can be dug up after the credits, only in the Remastered version.
You can get it solo by standing on the dig spot and you need to be below the arrow spam that's coming from the thief. Hold block to position yourself more precisely.
If you have 2 players, have one player block the arrows while the other player digs up the sword.

## <a name="softlock"></a>Battle softlock

*Needs more detail*

It's possible to become soft-locked after the credits by having the last two players kill eachother at the same time. 

## <a name="cutscene-fly"></a>Original CC cutscene fly

You have just enough time to tek from the fake kiss to (slowfall) fly during the ending cutscene.
