## <a name="barrier-skip"></a>Barrier skip in multiplayer

This glitch is able to skip Painter, Undead Cyclops & Necromancer without the need to beat them.

Requirements:
- Multiplayer for CPR minigame
- Both players don't have any of the 4 end bosses defeated
- One player needs to have Bipolar Bear equipped

The goal is to get killed by bipolar and fly to the end of the level where the crystal is located.

1. Teleports need to be on otherwise Bipolar Bear doesn't work
2. The player that is going to fly to the end needs to tek from the portals
3. The tekked player needs to die from the portal damage and land just before one of the entrances
4. The other player now needs to revive the player that just died with very low health so Bipolar will attack the player again
5. Both hold up after reviving so you enter the entrance and outrun the chasing Bipolar Bear
6. The player that is going to fly has 1 frame to pull the next move off
7. Immediately jump when enter the level and fly to the end of the level
8. The other player needs to wiggle the screen so the flying player can pass the right boundary
9. At the end of the level hold up to fly upstairs
10. Skip is done, beat the crystal so the level counts as completed
