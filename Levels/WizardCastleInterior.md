## <a name="barrier-skip"></a>Barrier skip in multiplayer

This glitch is able to skip Painter, Undead Cyclops & Necromancer without the need to beat them.

Requirements:

- Multiplayer for CPR minigame
- All players don't have the final boss defeated
- One player needs to have Bipolar Bear equipped
- 1 sandwich per boss skip (optimally 3 sandwiches)

The goal is to get killed by Bipolar Bear and fly to the end of the level where the crystal is located.

1. Teleports need to be on otherwise Bipolar Bear doesn't work
2. The player that is going to fly to the end needs to tek from the barriers
3. The tekked player needs to die from the barrier damage and land just before one of the entrances
4. The other player now needs to revive the player that just died with very low health so Bipolar Bear will attack the player again
5. Both hold up after reviving so you enter the entrance and outrun the chasing Bipolar Bear
6. The player that is going to fly has 1 frame to pull the next move off
7. Immediately jump when entering the level and try to stay in the air
8. Use a sandwich and keep flying after the sandwich animation completes
9. Fly to the end of the level
10. The other player needs to wiggle the screen so the flying player can pass the right boundary
11. At the end of the level hold up to fly upstairs
12. Skip is done, beat the crystal so the level counts as completed
