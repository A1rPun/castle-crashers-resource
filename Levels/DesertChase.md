## <a name="entrance"></a>Entrance animation

At the start of the level 2 saracens are entering the screen on camels. After a set time they will move towards you. If you knock them off the camels before this timer they will still enter their walking towards the player animation if the timer completes, resulting them to walk in mid-air.

## <a name="enemy-manip"></a>Enemy AI manipulation

Park the camels that spawned in the first wave to the left-most side of the level. This way the second and third wave AI won't go out of the screen looking for camels, they will look to move into your juggle instead.

## <a name="camel-mount"></a>Mount camel

Press J and immediately press H to get on a camel quickly.
You can also H-dash into the mount to get on it quickly.
Tornado characters can use their airnado to get on a mount quickly.

## <a name="camel-dry"></a>Camel dry mouth

Get on a camel and stand still.
After spitting with H there is a specific frame where you need to start moving.
If you got the right animation you need to keep moving, by for example holding up or down, otherwise the animation will complete.

## <a name="camel-spit"></a>Camel double spit

Get on a camel. Hold H to spit and repeatedly tap left or right. Sometimes the camel will spit 2 balls of spit.
It seems like only one can damage enemies tho.

## <a name="mount-juggle"></a>Camel juggle

Mount juggle. Stand still and press L repeatedly. You only want to hit with the initial light attack animation.

## <a name="camel-speed"></a>Speedy camels

**Multiplayer only**

TODO: Insert screenshots

Before you do this you need to make sure teleports are off.
You need to set this up in the second wave, and perform it in the third wave.
Multiple players can perform this, but the minimum requirement is 1 camel.

Get a camel on the right spot (screenshot) before you clear the second wave.
Clear the second wave and and leave one enemy alive in the third wave to make things easier.
One player needs to get on the camel which is barely reachable.
If that player got on the camel they need to walk off the screen and downwards, enter the screen after that and you will be stuck on the bottom of the screen.
Now the other player(s) needs to clear the third wave and get on a camel.

The player which is stuck at the bottom must stay at the left-most side of the screen while the other player(s) can move towards the cutscene. Enter the cutscene. After the cutscene the player on the left must walk out of left the screen while the other player(s) walk out of the right side of the screen while spamming arrows.

## <a name="camel-oob"></a>Camel OoB

Let the saracen walk all the way to the right of the screen. When he moves into the exit hit him off the camel with an arrow or projectile. The saracen is OoB now, so let him get on the camel again and it will move it to a location you can access. Knock the saracen off and get on the camel.

## <a name="cutscene-shorten"></a>Shortened Cutscene

Before triggering the cutscene shoot an arrow or projectile at the right spot to knock the saracen off the camel in the cutscene. This appears to shorten the cutscene, or at least it makes the quicksand dissapear immediately.

## <a name="scorpion-blind"></a>Blind scorpions

If teleports are off, scorpions won't attack you until you enter the one cutscene in this level.

## <a name="scorpion-manip"></a>Scorpion manipulation

While a scorpion attacks it is invulnerable to attacks. You can do 2 fun things with this.

1. Block and wait for a scorpion to hit, light attack and hold block again. Seems to confuse newcomers.
2. This one is easier done in multiplayer. Get a camel close to a scorpion and let the scorpion attack. Quickly get on the camel and run into the scorpion. It will change his walking direction if performed correctly.
3. Only in multiplayer. The above trick but then combined with the left-right spam movement. It will hit and change the direction of the scorpion multiple times, which only sounds and looks funny.

## <a name="scorpion-juggle"></a>Infinite scorpion juggle

If you are on a camel at the end of the level you can infinitly juggle a scorpion against the right-most wall below the exit.
Get a scorpion to bounce against the wall and stand under it.

## <a name="quicksand"></a>Quicksand strategy

Either fly over the quicksand with LHH or run to the right at the top of the screen by holding up+right.
