## <a name="strats"></a>Level strategy

Stay at the bottom of the screen so you won't get hit by rocks or arrows. There is one shark fin that can hit you, block or jump over that one.

## <a name="rock"></a>Rock glitch

Stand on a mount. Jump and get hit by a rock just before you land.
This will make it so you are swimming with the mount still on your position.

You can get on the mount again by blocking a shark fin (mid-air) at the right moment.

## <a name="tornado"></a>Tornado softlock

If you stop using tornado mid-air, your character will be teleported down into the water. The magic effect will remain at the same height you stopped using tornado at. If you try to jump while in this state, you will teleport back up into the sky and do the spin combo. If you stopped using tornado at a low elevation, you will be unable to get out of the state and will be softlocked until you get on a mount.

## <a name="jesus"></a>Walking on water

You can do a continuous ground combo or a MH on the water. Just perform the action just before you hit the water.

## <a name="sandwich"></a>Sandwich gone

One of the few levels that prevent a sandwich from being used.

## <a name="catfish"></a>Early exit to map on Catfish

If you exit the Catfish level quickly you will be on the Rapids Ride node.
