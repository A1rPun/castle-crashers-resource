## <a name="boss"></a>Mini-boss strategy

Do middleweight combo's and try to reset, don't drop the boss at the edge of the level because it will roll+tornado.
Be sure not to swordlock with the bear, basically refrain from doing a ground combo.

## <a name="double-damage"></a>Double damage flag enemies

If any player doesn't get into a swordlock, all flag enemies will recieve double damage. These enemies include:

- Bear mini-boss
- Beefy bear
- Bear
- Thief

Try to spin combo them to death for fun.

## <a name="climb-softlock"></a>Infinite climb softlock

1. Make sure teleports are off
2. Enter the level via Pipistrello's Cave
3. Drop down from the cliff and spawn the last wave
4. Extend the screen, one player needs to be all the way to the left
5. The other player needs to shrink the screen by moving left
6. The player that just get OOB must kill the 2 arrow machines
7. Kill the bears so only 2 are left
8. Advance to the left until the beefies appear
9. Go back to the cliff to the right by killing the normal bears, not the beefies
10. Stand in front of the cliff, hit a beefy with at least 1 spin (1dmg)
11. Let the bear beefy throw you into the cliff
12. You're now softlocked

## <a name="arrow-machines"></a>Fly over arrow machines

Use the fly combo to get high enough so you can fly over them, even possibe without hitting them.

## <a name="cave"></a>Cave

Accessible with a sandwich

### <a name="projectile-spam"></a>Projectile spam to access Burly Bear

This can only be done with characters that have an aerial projectile. Ex: not with Blue Knight or Tornado characters.

1. Get to the right of the cracked wall, your character against the wall on the top
2. There should be a spot that stops you from moving left
3. If you found the spot, face right
4. Get into slowfall, then uppercut and immediately projectile spam
5. While doing that hold up
6. You should be inside the cave now
