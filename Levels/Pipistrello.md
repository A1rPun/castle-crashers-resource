## Boss strategy

1. Stand on the left side against the wall, facing right. Do this because when Pipistrello attacks, you won't get licked out of your position.
2. Press up 1 or 2 times depending on your current position, this will make it so Pipistrello will go into the idle animation.
3. Drill, Block & Repeat

## Pipistrello stuck

If Pipistrello attacks, you can get him stuck into a walking or idle animation by only moving vertically. If you move a pixel horizontally he will get unstuck.

## Invisible poop

When you run into a poop it will become invisible but you are still able to hit it.
When Pipistrello rises up again these poop will get removed, they only stay infinite if you kill Pipistrello after a poop has become invisible.

## Bat count

On initialization there are 20 bats spawned. This is also the maximum.

Pipistrello Health|Bats spawned|`spawn_timer`
---|---|---
<70%|2|10
<50%|6|30
<30%|10|50

## Invincible bats

After 10+ bats have spawned there is a possibility that there will be invincible bats flying to the left that you can't hit. Resulting in those bats never spawn again because they stay alive offscreen.

## Broken bats

You can enter a state that bats try to attack you but can't bite your head.

1. Hold block
2. Get bitten by a bat
3. Get licked by Pipistrello

The bat that was biting your head becomes invisible, you can see the shadow still. You can even kill it and it won't void the glitch. Getting licked again or running into poop will void this glitch.

## Stuck bats

Bats can get stuck on walls or other terrain.

## Tall Grass Field Cave

On the left side of Pipistrello's Cave there is Tall Grass Field Cave.
On the right side of Pipistrello's Cave there is Pipistrello's Cave Treasure Room.

## Offscreen fish sword

Only possible with multiple players. Teleports need to be off.

In the first wave of slimes one character needs to die on top of the skeleton body on the ground.
The other player then defeats the wave and spawns the second wave of slimes.
Revive the other player.
If done right both characters should be offscreen.
Walk all the way to the left past the entrance.
Now you should be able to align yourself with a chest and boomerang the weapon.
