## <a name="boss"></a>Boss strategy

1. Stand on the left side against the wall (facing right). Do this because when Pipistrello attacks, you won't get licked out of your position.
2. Press up 1 or 2 times depending on your current position, this will make it so Pipistrello will go into the idle animation.
3. Drill, Block, Repeat

## <a name="pip-stuck"></a>Pipistrello stuck

If Pipistrello attacks, you can get him stuck into a walking or idle animation by only moving vertically. If you move a pixel horizontally he will get unstuck.

## <a name="slime-drill"></a>Slime drill

This is an insane only strategy.
Only move your character on the top of the level so that slimes only move horizontally parallel to the background wall. Now you can drill or juggle more easily.

## <a name="slime-glitch"></a>Broken slime

1. Hold block
2. Get jumped on by a slime
3. Get the slime off using another enemy

## <a name="slime-stuck"></a>Slime stuck

Attacking a slime when they are about to jump on you can get them stuck in tha air for a second.

## <a name="poop-invis"></a>Invisible poop

When you run into a poop it will become invisible but you are still able to hit it.
When Pipistrello rises up again these poop will get removed, they only stay infinite if you kill Pipistrello after a poop has become invisible.

## <a name="bats"></a>Bat count

On initialization there are 20 bats spawned. This is also the maximum.

Pipistrello Health|Bats spawned|spawn_timer
---|---|---
<70%|2|10
<50%|6|30
<30%|10|50

## <a name="bats-invincible"></a>Invincible bats

After 10+ bats have spawned there is a possibility that there will be invincible bats flying to the left that you can't hit. Resulting in those bats never spawn again because they stay alive offscreen.

## <a name="bats-glitch"></a>Broken bats

You can enter a state that bats try to attack you but can't bite your head.

1. Hold block
2. Get bitten by a bat
3. Get licked by Pipistrello

The bat that bitten you head becomes invisible, you can see the shadow still. You can even kill it and it won't void the glitch. Getting licked again or running into poop will void this glitch.

## <a name="bats-stuck"></a>Stuck bats

Bats can get stuck on walls or other terrain.

## <a name="cave"></a>Tall Grass Field Cave

On the left side of Pipistrello's Cave there is Tall Grass Field Cave.
On the right side of Pipistrello's Cave there is Pipistrello's Cave Treasure Room.

2. Have Pipistrello constantly fly into the air by running around
3. Optionally kill bats
4. ????
