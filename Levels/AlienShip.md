## Bypass lasers

You can bypass lasers with a sandwich.

1. Stand next to the lasers so you're just one step away from getting zapped
2. Press sandwich and hold right at the same time
3. After the sandwich animation you should have bypassed the lasers

You can drag other players with you once you bypassed the lasers by running to the right. The other players must let themselves get zapped. This will let the other players pass with the help of invisibility frames. Do note you'll get softlocked at the end of the level.

## Dark player texture

Just before the cutscene starts you need to get electrocuted.
Recovery jump works best for this.
It's easier to do this with multiple players.

## 2 players 1 exit

It's possible to enter the exit doors with multiple players.

## PS3 OOB

There is a spot where you can clip through the background layer. This spot is just after the first lasers and at the top of the level.

## Open lasers earlier

When fighting the 100+ aliens you can use saws or a frog tongue to open the lasers early.
Do this by positioning yourself all the way to the right of the screen and aligned with the post that disables the lasers. It isn't possible to do this at the start of the wave unfortunately, only when the last few aliens spawn.

## Death by tek

A silly way to die is to ground tek on top of the steam vents and let your health evaporate.

## The first level

In code this level is id 1, that maybe explains why it's alien hominid themed and the developers are in it.
