## <a name="bypass"></a>Bypass lasers

You can bypass lasers with a sandwich.

1. Stand next to the lasers so you're just one step away from getting zapped
2. Press sandwich and hold right at the same time
3. After the sandwich animation you should have bypassed the lasers

You can drag other players with you once you bypassed the lasers by running to the right. The other players must let themselves get zapped. This will let the other players pass with the help of invisibility frames.
