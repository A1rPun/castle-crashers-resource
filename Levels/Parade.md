## General strategy

There are spots where you can stand the first half of the level without getting hit. Just spam heavy or jump and light attack.
When the troll comes just lightweight juggle it.

## No hit

For 13 years everyone believed the game couldn't be beaten without hits because of the mandatory hit you take at the end of Parade. Flamming found out that it's possible to avoid getting hit.

## Softlock

Tek into cyclops' shoulder. Do this by first jumping onto cyclops' shoulder to get a possiblity to tek. So your basically jumping twice into the same spot.

It's also possible to tek fly into cyclops' shoulder. If you fly to another spot and do a LHL combo you can get softlocked elsewhere.

## No exp troll

Doing damage to the troll boss does not give exp.
