## <a name="beefy-oob"></a>Beefy

Requirements:

- 2 players or more
- At least one player must have a sandwich
- Both players will need sandwiches if both players want to get out of the map
- For the best OOB experience: [disable teleports](#teleports)

Execution:

- Have a player use a sandwich
- Have the beefy player pick up the other player
- The beefy player must hold the other player outside of the map (Hold them as close to the left or right wall as possible)
- When the beefy clock ends the player will be out of bounds

If both players brought a sandwich, the player outside of the map can pick up the other player while in beefy form to bring the other outside with them.

## <a name="teleports"></a>Teleports

Teleports happen when a player goes OOB, the game tries to teleport them back in bounds.
Teleports can also cause desyncs.

You can disable teleports by exiting to map while a cutscene is playing. Some levels will end in a cutscene for example Lava World and Industrial Castle.

Parade & Pirate Ship have teleports disabled for the entirety of the level.

### <a name="bipolar"></a>Bipolar broken

When teleports are off Bipolar will stop mauling enemies and/or friends.

### <a name="scorpions"></a>Blind Scorpions

Scorpions won't attack if teleports are off.
