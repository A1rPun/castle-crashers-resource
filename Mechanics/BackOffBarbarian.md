Meme_Cuisine wrote:

- Memorize patterns and how maps are structured
- Get used to map & pattern rotation
- Keep a fair 1-3 open space between you and the enemies
- Keep enemies grouped together so they aren't spread out and one won't randomly be in your way while the rest are on the other side of the map
- If you have to, button mash with some kind of momentum beforehand so you don't fatigue so fast
- Hop to the beat of the music if that helps (it does for me)
- Some good maps are castle drawbridge, ice castle, vertically longways lava world, castle outskirts, pretty much maps with open space and room to traverse corners
- Pick a character that stands out from the background (Red Knight for example)
- BE A GOOD TEAMMATE, it's critical for success in this gamemode. It's best to stay as close to each other as possible to keep the enemy horde compact and away from the team
- If you're playing with a team, don't go afk or sit in a spot where it blocks your teammates' path. It's annoying enough as it is
- Keep the spamming to a low, the more you spam aimlessly the more tired your character gets, and the more tired your character gets the chances of you getting stomped also increases
- If all else fails, pause buffer

## <a name="pattern"></a>Pattern

This pattern will appear in every map, the rotation or flip is determined randomly.

## <a name="glitch-spot"></a>4th player glitch spot

Mostly used for boosting the BoB achievement/trophy quickly. Only works for the 4th player.

- Play until you enter [Double Layered Snow World](#snowworld2) (RNG)
- Player 1, 2 and 3 need to leave when that happens
- Player 4 doesn't move in the spot until 2:30 passes

## <a name="spots"></a>Spots

In [Triple Layered Overworld](#overworld1).
If the player stands on the indicated spot on the top layer, the AI will attempt to chase the player by going upwards. This of course is not possible but the AI attempts to do so anyway. This is an effective method for surviving without having to run away as you can sit in this one spot and watch as they try to get you from being stuck in the middle layer. This does not last forever however, as the AI will eventually make a random move and go around and up to chase you, in which you then would need to start running. This can be repeated if the AI's are NOT on the top layer of this map, and they are stuck in the middle and/or or bottom layers.
