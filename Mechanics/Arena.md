## <a name="rules"></a>Unwritten rules

- Don't tek abuse. This just means that you don't rely on tek to combo someone
- If you get the arena with the mount, escort it to the top (corner) before starting the fight
- Refrain from comboing people when they got hit by the cat or geyser
- Controllers can disconnect or people can be AFK, it's nice if you don't hit them while they're standing still
- If you hit someone accidentally before the fight they have the right to do the same damage back
- Tornado sliding is considered cheap
- Don't drag people into campaign arena
- Don't use potions in campaign arena

## <a name="strats"></a>Strats

Movement is key. Try to read your opponent and have a counter for everything.

### <a name="stats"></a>Stat distribution

Agility is the best stat for arena. Strength and criticals on your weapon are good too.

### <a name="resets"></a>Resets

It takes _TODO: quote needed_ second(s) for an enemy player to stand up, in this time you can prepare for a reset.

#### <a name="reset-mj"></a>Magic jump reset

Commonly used by doing a MJ on the frame the opponent stands up. Can be countered if it's incorrectly timed by a MJ.

#### <a name="reset-ms"></a>Splash reset

Do a MS just before the opponent stands up. Every character has different timings. Most of the time the opponent bounces towards you for an easy juggle setup.
Can be countered if it's incorrectly timed by holding up or down.

_TODO: insert Flamming's audio/framelength comparison_

#### <a name="reset-ap"></a>Air projectile reset

You can prepare for an aerial reset by ending your combo with a spinning uppercut (LHL).
Can be countered if it's incorrectly timed. Can also be countered with block if the projectile faces the opponent, so attack from behind.
