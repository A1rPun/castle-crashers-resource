## <a name="rules"></a>Unwritten rules

- Don't tek abuse. This just means that you don't rely on tek to combo someone, use it only to counter attack
- If you get the arena with the mount, escort it to the top (corner) before starting the fight
- Refrain from comboing people when they got hit by the cat or geyser
- Controllers can disconnect or people can be AFK, it's nice if you don't hit them while they're standing still
- If you hit someone accidentally before the fight they have the right to do the same damage back
- Tornado sliding is considered cheap
- Don't drag people into campaign arena
- Don't use potions in campaign arena

2|1v1v1, 2v1v1
3|1v1v1v1

The wins or loses on the arena leaderboards will cap out at 65535 for every mode played, meaning you can have a maximum of 262140 wins or loses. The score will cap at 2147483647.

## <a name="win-glitch"></a>Win glitch

Mostly used to get the 40 wins achievement/trophy in arena.

_Written for Playstation_

You will need 3 people to set up the glitch OR 2 people, 1 player with 2 controllers (and 2 PSN accounts, psplus not needed for second account). 1 player will not get the wins so discuss who sacrifices for this glitch. In case you do this with 2 controllers just logout the second controller in step 4.

1. Join an arena lobby with 2 others and choose your characters.
2. Next up it is important to have the 2 players that need the wins choose the same flag. The other player should have a different flag.
3. Start melee and enter the fight
4. The player who chose to sacrifice needs to leave the match now.
5. The other players will get an insta-win. You now will return to arena mode select screen.
6. Keep entering melee and you will get your free wins. You can hold down J the entire time if you want.

Do not change flags while in this glitched state otherwise you have to do the steps above again for it to work. 

## <a name="melee"></a>Melee

### <a name="strats"></a>Strats

Movement is key. Try to read your opponent and have a counter for everything.

### <a name="stats"></a>Stat distribution

Agility is the best stat for arena. Strength and criticals on your weapon are good too.

### <a name="resets"></a>Resets

It takes _TODO: quote needed_ second(s) for an enemy player to stand up, in this time you can prepare for a reset.

#### <a name="reset-mj"></a>Magic jump reset

Commonly used by doing a MJ on the frame the opponent stands up. Can be countered if it's incorrectly timed by a MJ.

#### <a name="reset-ms"></a>Splash reset

Do a MS just before the opponent stands up. Every character has different timings. Most of the time the opponent bounces towards you for an easy juggle setup.
Can be countered if it's incorrectly timed by holding up or down.

_TODO: insert Flamming's audio/framelength comparison_

#### <a name="reset-ap"></a>Air projectile reset

You can prepare for an aerial reset by ending your combo with a spinning uppercut (LHL).
Can be countered if it's incorrectly timed. Can also be countered with block if the projectile faces the opponent, so attack from behind.

## <a name="quickdraw"></a>Quickdraw

Try to get as much powerups as possible first and prevent the opponents from grabbing pickups. If powerups appear on the other side where you are you can get them offscreen so the opponent can't get the powerup.

If the opponent doesn't know how to tek you can zero-to-death by repeatedly stomping on the opponent.

## <a name="treasure"></a>Treasure

Try to get as much gold as you can obviously.

Shovel does damage and can be used to get your opponent out of a dig. If an opponent tries to shovel you, block or run away. Always try shovel with your back to the opponent so you can hit them if they come near.

When an opponent tries to camp your reward just wait. Either the opponent tries to dig in another spot or they run to you and try to dig in the same spot. When they dig in another spot it's easy, just dig your reward. When they are running towards you, dig immediately. This results in you hitting the opponent with the shovel and you can collect the reward faster than the opponent can.

The only really annoying way people can camp is to stand in front of your digspot so you can't hit them with your shovel. Either be extremely patient or accept your defeat.

## <a name="beefy"></a>Beefy

You can zero-to-death an opponent in this mode. Get a chicken as soon as you can. Use the following combo on a player that isn't beefy: J and spam L or H. If the opponent drops down, wait till he stands up (reset) and do the combo again.

If the player is beefy try to enter the minigame and spam all action buttons. You can also try to tek beefy juggle your opponent.

If the opponent blocks you can grab him, walk to an edge and throw. Now you can start a juggle immediately.

In original CC you can throw your opponent while not in beefy form, this is removed in Remastered.
