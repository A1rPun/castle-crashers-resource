## <a name="rules"></a>Unwritten rules

- Don't tek abuse. This just means that you don't rely on tek to combo someone
- If you get the arena with the mount, escort it to the top (corner) before starting the fight
- Refrain from comboing people when they got hit by the cat or geyser
- Controllers can disconnect or people can be AFK, it's nice if you don't hit them while they're standing still
- If you hit someone accidentally before the fight they have the right to do the same damage back
- Tornado sliding is considered cheap
- Don't use potions in campaign arena
