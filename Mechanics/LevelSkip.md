# Level skipping

To earn a skull after beating Final Battle you need to beat specific levels. Most of these levels are checkpoint levels and will unlock 1 or 2 prior levels. Level skipping as described here is only possible in multiplayer because you rely on another player that has already beaten a checkpoint level. This method is possible in local multiplayer if you have the right setup, on some platforms you can even level skip 3 of your own characters at once.

## Levels

These are the levels that you need to beat. Collecting relics doesn't matter.

- Barbarian War (not a checkpoint level)
- Barbarian Boss
- Thieves Forest
- Catfish
- Pipistrello's Cave
- Wedding Crash (not a checkpoint level)
- Cyclops' Fortress
- Lava World
- Industrial Castle
- Alien Ship (not a checkpoint level)
- Sand Castle Roof
- Corn Boss
- Medusa's Lair
- Ice Castle
- Painter's Room Crystal (not a checkpoint level)
- Undead Cyclops' Room Crystal (not a checkpoint level)
- Final Battle (Player needs to be alive)

To unlock the full traversal of the overworld map:

- Castle Keep (can be bypassed via insane mode node)
- Parade
- Pirate Ship
- Desert Chase

To remove all arrows you need to collect all relics and beat:

- Full Moon

## Save skip

Some of the levels that are required for game completion are not checkpoint levels and therefore need to be beaten or skipped. Skipping requires you to beat the corresponding checkpoint level and save the progress by "refreshing the lobby". This can be done by leaving the game or in the case of an insane mode lobby, by going into normal mode and then back into insane mode.

### Castle Keep skip
Beat the first wave of Barbarian War and exit left to Castle Keep. Exit the empty Castle Keep to beat it.

### Barbarian War skip
If you beat Barbarian Boss you will unlock the requirement for Barbarian War after refreshing the lobby.

### Wedding Crash & Parade skip
Enter Cyclops' Cave, exit left to Parade, exit right into Cyclops' Cave again and then exit to map. This will unlock the requirement for Wedding Crash and unlock Parade as checkpoint level after refreshing the lobby.

### Pirate Ship skip

Pirate Ship is not needed for completion but it blocks traversal to the right side of the dock. To access the Desert without beating Pirate Ship you need to have beaten Desert Chase and have the relics needed for Dock.
Enter Dock and exit to map when you enter Pirate Ship, now you can traverse to Desert and beyond.

### Alien Ship skip
If you beat Desert Chase you will unlock the requirement for Alien Ship after refreshing the lobby.

### Painter & Undead Cyclops skip
If you beat Final Battle you will unlock the requirement for Painter's Room and Undead Cyclops' Room after refreshing the lobby.
This means you have to do Final Battle twice.
