# Level skipping

To earn a skull after beating Final Battle you need to beat specific levels. Most of these levels are checkpoint levels and will unlock 1 or 2 prior levels. Level skipping as described here is only possible in multiplayer because you rely on another player that has already beaten a checkpoint level. This method is possible in local multiplayer if you have the right setup, on some platforms you can even level skip 3 of your own characters at once.

## Levels

These are the levels that you need to beat. Collecting relics doesn't matter.

- Barbarian War
- Barbarian Boss
- Thieves Forest

### Castle Keep skip
Beat the first wave of Barbarian War and exit left to Castle Keep. Exit the empty Castle Keep to beat it.

### Barbarian War skip
If you beat Barbarian Boss you will unlock the requirement for Barbarian War. This will only be visible once you refresh the lobby.

### Wedding Crash & Parade skip
Enter Cyclops' Cave, exit left to Parade, exit right into Cyclops' Cave again and then exit to map. This will unlock the requirement for Wedding Crash and unlock Parade as checkpoint level. This will only be visible once you refresh the lobby.

### Alien Ship & Desert Chase skip
If you beat Desert Chase you will unlock the requirement for Alien Ship. This will only be visible once you refresh the lobby.

### Painter & Undead Cyclops & Final Battle skip
If you beat Final Battle you will unlock the requirement for Painter's Room and Undead Cyclops' Room.
This means you have to do Final Battle twice.
