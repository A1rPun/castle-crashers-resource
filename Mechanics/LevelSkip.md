# Level skipping

Level skipping as described here is only possible in (local) multiplayer because you rely on another player/character that has already beaten the game.

Each individual character has progress for normal mode (white skull) and insane mode (golden skull).
After defeating the Final Boss the game checks specific levels to see if you earned a skull.
Most of these levels are checkpoint levels. Checkpoint levels often hold the progress for multiple levels that came before it, that means that you only need to beat less than half of the levels.

## Optimal Route

1. Barbarian Boss
2. Thieves Forest
3. Catfish
4. Pipistrello's Cave
5. Parade skip
6. Cyclops' Fortress
7. Lava World
8. Industrial Castle
9. Desert Chase

- First chance to refresh lobby for skips (1, 5, 9)

10. Sand Castle Roof
11. Corn Boss
12. Medusa's Lair
13. Ice Castle

- Last chance to refresh lobby for skips (1, 5, 9)

14. Wizard Castle Interior
    14.1. Painter's Room Crystal
    14.2. Undead Cyclops' Room Crystal
15. Final Battle (player needs to be alive)

After following this route there could be arrows on the following levels, this doesn't matter for the progress.

- Blacksmith if you didn't pick up the Compass
- Home Castle
- Industrial Castle if you didn't pick up the Telescope
- Dock
- Corn Boss if you didn't pick up the Horn
- Full Moon

## Required levels

These are the levels that you need to beat.

- Barbarian War (not a checkpoint level)
- Barbarian Boss
- Thieves Forest
- Catfish
- Pipistrello's Cave
- Wedding Crash (not a checkpoint level)
- Cyclops' Fortress
- Lava World
- Industrial Castle
- Alien Ship (not a checkpoint level)
- Sand Castle Roof
- Corn Boss
- Medusa's Lair
- Ice Castle
- Wizard Castle Interior (not a checkpoint level)
  - Painter's Room Crystal
  - Undead Cyclops' Room Crystal
- Final Battle (player needs to be alive)

To unlock the full traversal of the overworld map:

- Castle Keep (can be bypassed via insane mode node)
- Parade
- Pirate Ship (can be bypassed quickly)
- Desert Chase

To remove all arrows you need to collect all relics and beat Full Moon.

## Save skip

Some of the levels that are required for game completion are not checkpoint levels and therefore need to be beaten or skipped. Skipping requires you to beat the corresponding checkpoint level and save the progress by "refreshing the lobby". This can be done by leaving the game or in the case of an insane mode lobby, by going into normal mode and then back into insane mode.

### Castle Keep skip

Beat the first wave of Barbarian War and exit left to Castle Keep. Exit the empty Castle Keep to beat it.

### Barbarian War skip

If you beat Barbarian Boss you will unlock the requirement for Barbarian War after refreshing the lobby.

### Wedding Crash & Parade skip

Enter Cyclops' Cave, exit left to Parade, exit right into Cyclops' Cave again and then exit to map. This will unlock the requirement for Wedding Crash and unlock Parade as checkpoint level after refreshing the lobby.

### Bypass Pirate Ship

Pirate Ship is not needed for completion but it blocks traversal to the right side of the dock. To access the Desert without beating Pirate Ship you need to have beaten Desert Chase and have the relics needed for Dock.
Enter Dock and exit to map when you enter Pirate Ship, now you can traverse to Desert and beyond.

### Alien Ship skip

If you beat Desert Chase you will unlock the requirement for Alien Ship after refreshing the lobby.

### Painter & Undead Cyclops skip

If you beat Final Battle you will unlock the requirement for Painter's Room and Undead Cyclops' Room after refreshing the lobby.
This means you have to do Final Battle twice.
