You can get back into the air with LH L+H LHH combo.

## <a name="running-tek"></a>Running tek

To run in tek: Tornado for a split second on the frame you land from tek and hold any direction.

Keep running to hold this tek, you are able to use the tornado and more. Only possible with Bear & Saracen. Running tek can be achieved with all characters on the climb section in Tall Grass Field but that one is useless.

Common usages:

- Ice Castle entrance
- Desert insane
- Arena cheese

## <a name="tek-ladder"></a>Ladder tek

To ladder tek: Be on the bottom of the ladder and let yourself get knocked off by a stoveface or iceskimo. Tek and start a LHH combo. Spam LHH to get rid of the enemies.

It's essentialy the same as the ladder glitch with the added benefit of tek. There are a few moves that will get you out of this state so be careful what buttons you press.

Only usage:

- Full Moon

## <a name="tek-death"></a>Deathtek

2 setups by Flamming:

- Get in tek, equip sandwich, get 0 health (0 potions in MP), use a sandwich and land on a fruit.
- Get in tek, get 0 health (0 potions in MP), get hit by fire/poison and land on a fruit.

This tek will let you move out of the screen. Doing this with 2+ players will end the level because the game thinks everyone died.

Levels with good setups:
Industrial Castle, Corn Boss, Tall Grass Field.

Common usages:

- Trolling
- Coop speedrun
