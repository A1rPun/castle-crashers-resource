# Antlion

There is a spot right next to the antlion where the toxic bubble can't hit you. Find the spot by moving up and down, if the antlion just turned his head to the top you stand on the right spot.

You can also do a lightweight juggle against the antlion, you will not be afflicted by quicksand this way.

A coop way to deal a lot of damage is to have 1 player get grabbed by the antlion and then the other player needs to do drill combos.
