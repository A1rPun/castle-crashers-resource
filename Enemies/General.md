## Middleweight

Doing resets to instantly put a middle weight enemy into a juggle the frame they stand up is the best strategy for PvP
Using magic jump is the most common and reliable way to reset, however it requires perfect time and lag can very often screw up timing
Using some splash attacks can make resetting a little less precise on timing. Vines, saws, arrow rain and fire demon are some common splashes for resetting
Some characters can also use their projectiles for resetting, such as bomb characters, saracen's "projectile" acts as a splash and blue knight's freeze are some examples.
