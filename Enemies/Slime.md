## Slime drill

This is an insane only strategy.
Only move your character at the top of the level so that slimes only move horizontally parallel to the background wall. Now you can drill or juggle more easily.

## Broken slime

1. Hold block
2. Get jumped on by a slime
3. Get the slime off using another enemy

## Slime stuck

Attacking a slime when they are about to jump on you can get them stuck in the air for a second.

## Throw slimes in death animation

When you defeat a slime it will do an animation. You can still throw it in this animation.

## Beefy grab slime

When grabbing a slime in beefy form it will jump out but the beefy character still holds an invisible object.

## Slime duplication
