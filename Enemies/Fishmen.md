# Fishmen

When you attack the fishmen 4 times it will jump into the air. Imagine a middle point on the fishmen's body, attacking him from the left side will let the fishmen jump to the left and vice versa.

## Drill LLLHH

Start a drill combo from, for example, the left side and after you hit your elemental infusion move (tap) left to drill into the jumping fishmen. This will position you for the next drill.
Start your next combo before the fishmen landed, this way it won't attack.
The first hit of the drill doesn't need to hit an enemy anyway.
