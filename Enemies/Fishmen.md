# Fishmen

When you attack the fishmen 4 times it will jump towards you. Imagine a middle point on the fishmen's body, attacking him from the left side will let the fishmen jump to the left and vice versa. This is only true if the fishmen is following you.

## Drill LLLHH

Example: Start a drill combo from the left side and after you hit your elemental infusion, move (tap) left to drill the fishmen who now jumps towards you. This will position you for the next drill.
Start your next combo before the fishmen lands, this way it won't attack you.
The first hit of the drill combo doesn't need to hit an enemy anyway.
