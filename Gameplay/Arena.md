## <a name="rules"></a>Unwritten rules

- Don't tek abuse. This just means that you don't rely on tek to combo a player, use it only to counter attack
- If you get the arena with the mount, escort it to the top (corner) before starting the fight
- Refrain from comboing a player when they got hit by the cat's paw or geyser by accident
- Controllers can disconnect or a player can be AFK, it's nice if you don't hit them while they're standing still
- If you hit a player (accidentally) before the fight they have the right to do the same damage back
- Tornado sliding is considered cheap
- Don't drag a player into campaign arena
- Don't use potions in campaign arena only if you're up against a hacker

### <a name="onevone"></a>1v1

Pretty straightforward, defeat the opponent. Usually you agree before the match how many matches there will be played. First to 10 (FT10) is commonly used. For casual play you just play until life happens.

### <a name="multiple"></a>1v1v1 or 1v1v1v1

There are 2 frequently played modes in melee:

1. Free For All
2. Rotating 1v1

Free For All is used in other arena modes. Can also be fun with expierenced players.
Rotating 1v1 is the most played. It goes like this:

1 or 2 players wait at the top of the arena so the other players can 1v1.
If one of the players is defeated the player(s) at the top can start a 1v1.
Once the rounds end and all players decide to play again, players can rotate places like this:

Last round, Player A & Player B started.
Next round, Player B & Player C start and you can continue this loop with 3 or 4 players.

Sometimes it's not this strict so you'll have to adapt.

## <a name="score"></a>Score

You get a point for every team/flag in the game.

Points|Setup
---|---
1|1v1, 1v2, 1v3, 2v2
2|1v1v1, 1v1v2
3|1v1v1v1

The wins or loses on the arena leaderboards will cap out at 65535 for every mode played, meaning you can have a maximum of 262140 wins or loses. The score will cap at 2147483647.

## <a name="win-glitch"></a>Win glitch

Mostly used to get the 40 wins achievement/trophy in arena.

_Written for Playstation_

You will need 3 people to set up the glitch OR 2 people, 1 player with 2 controllers (and 2 PSN accounts, psplus not needed for second account). 1 player will not get the wins so discuss who sacrifices for this glitch. In case you do this with 2 controllers just logout the second controller in step 4.

1. Join an arena lobby with 2 others and choose your characters.
2. Next up it is important to have the 2 players that need the wins choose the same flag. The other player should have a different flag.
3. Start melee and enter the fight
4. The player who chose to sacrifice needs to leave the match now.
5. The other players will get an insta-win. You now will return to arena mode select screen.
6. Keep entering melee and you will get your free wins. You can hold down J the entire time if you want.

Do not change flags while in this glitched state otherwise you have to do the steps above again for it to work. 

## <a name="melee"></a>Melee

### <a name="strats"></a>Strats

Movement is key so have at least some stats in agility. Try to read your opponent and have a counter for every situation.

#### <a name="ice"></a>Against ice

Ice grants the opponent just enough time to setup a juggle.

Blue Knight is the most intense character do play against unless you are using Yeti as animal orb.
Aerial ice can be countered with movement. Ice projectiles can be counterered with block or movement.
Just know that Blue Knight drains his mana very quickly so use that as your advantage.

Iceskimo has a very good splash just like Blue Knight. Stay away from mid-range on the same horizontal position.

#### <a name="alien"></a>Against Alien Hominid

Watch out for splash slide spam, counter it with aerial projectiles or good movement.
When the opponent tries to reset from a distance with splash attacks, counter it with tek.

#### <a name="blacksmith"></a>Against Blacksmith

Keep an tongu... eye out for when Blacksmith is aerial. Blocking is not much of use against Blacksmith's aerial splash, jumping is.  

#### <a name="campers"></a>Against campers

3 out of 5 (66.666666666667% chance) arena maps have cats at the sides of the arena. They can be abused because of the wonky movements around the cat, they also obstruct the players visibility. There are multiple spots and strategies so that the cat will hit its paw but won't hit the player.

- Above the paw while flying
- Standing behind the paw on a specific vertical position
- Standing in front of the paw on a specific vertical position
- Running through the paw when it's not active

THERE ARE NO STRATEGIES TO THIS, SPAM MAGIC OR SOMETINHGGGGGGG.

### <a name="resets"></a>Resets

It takes _TODO: quote needed_ second(s) for an enemy player to stand up, in this time you can prepare for a reset.
An opponent can tek out of the landing but there is a way to prevent this. The current theory is that the player needs to be at a specific weight when it bounces off the ground, meaning you have to do at least ~15+ hits to keep the player in the air so it increases it's weight value.

Being at a higher Z position (meaning vertical on ground) yields the best results with a few exceptions like Red Knight's Splash.

#### <a name="reset-mj"></a>Magic jump reset

Commonly used by doing a MJ on the frame the opponent stands up. Can be countered if it's incorrectly timed by a MJ.

#### <a name="reset-mh"></a>Splash reset

Do a MH just before the opponent stands up. Every character has different timings. Most of the time the opponent bounces towards you for an easy juggle setup.
Can be countered if it's incorrectly timed by holding up or down.

_TODO: insert Flamming's audio/framelength comparison_

#### <a name="reset-light"></a>Light attack reset (decapitation reset)

Stand next to the opponent and time an unblockable light attack.

This reset can also be used to do a decapitation reset when the opponent is one-hit.

This can be combined with an splash or projectile reset.

#### <a name="reset-slam"></a>Slam reset

This is mostly used in campaign but can be used in arena.
Can be countered easily because the player needs to be at a low Y position (jump height) and because of the timing.
If the opponent doesn't block or MJ the mistiming this still can be effective.
Use it when in tek so you can only be countered by a block. Even when countered by a block one can be aggressivly combo the opponent till it releases block.

This can be combined with an splash or projectile reset.

#### <a name="reset-mh-projectile"></a>Air projectile reset

You can prepare for an aerial reset by ending your combo with a spinning uppercut (LHL). Do a MH after the LHL on the correct angle depending on the air projectile.

After the projectile hits you can do HLHH or LHL to continue juggling.

Can be countered if it's incorrectly timed. Can also be countered with block if the projectile faces the opponent, so attack from behind. Blue Knight, Saracen and Blacksmith don't have this block restriction.

#### <a name="reset-mu"></a>Projectile reset

The setup is just like an air projectile reset only now you have to do a MU just before you land after a LHL.

#### <a name="reset-bomb"></a>Bomb reset

The setup is just like an air projectile reset. Some players even use 2 bouncing bombs for the setup.
One can also bomb reset with MU in air.

#### <a name="reset-arrow"></a>Arrow reset

Very risky and hard to perform because of the specific timing, position & run speed. Every arrow reset is clip worthy.
Just like the other projectile resets, you want to attack the opponent from behind.

After you shoot the arrow, run into the opponent and J+L or J+H to start a new combo.

## <a name="quickdraw"></a>Quickdraw

Try to get as much powerups as possible first and prevent the opponents from grabbing pickups. If powerups appear on the other side where you are you can get them offscreen so the opponent can't get the powerup.

If the opponent doesn't know how to tek you can zero-to-death by repeatedly stomping on the opponent.

## <a name="treasure"></a>Treasure

Try to get as much gold as you can obviously.

Shovel does damage and can be used to get your opponent out of a dig. If an opponent tries to shovel you, block or run away. Always try shovel with your back to the opponent so you can hit them if they come near.

When an opponent tries to camp your reward just wait. Either the opponent tries to dig in another spot or they run to you and try to dig in the same spot. When they dig in another spot it's easy, just dig your reward. When they are running towards you, dig immediately. This results in you hitting the opponent with the shovel and you can collect the reward faster than the opponent can.

The only really annoying way people can camp is to stand in front of your digspot so you can't hit them with your shovel. Either be extremely patient or accept your defeat.

## <a name="beefy"></a>Beefy

You can zero-to-death an opponent in this mode. Get a chicken as soon as you can. Use the following combo on a player that isn't beefy: J and spam L or H. If the opponent drops down, wait till he stands up (reset) and do the combo again.

If the player is beefy try to enter the minigame and spam all action buttons. You can also try to tek beefy juggle your opponent.

If the opponent blocks you can grab him, walk to an edge and throw. Now you can start a juggle immediately.

In original CC you can throw your opponent while not in beefy form, this is removed in Remastered.
