_Written for Playstation_

You will need 3 people to set up the glitch OR 2 people, 1 player with 2 controllers (and 2 PSN accounts, psplus not needed for second account). 1 player will not get the wins so discuss who sacrifices for this glitch. In case you do this with 2 controllers just logout the second controller in step 4.

1. Join an arena lobby with 2 others and choose your characters.
2. Next up it is important to have the 2 players that need the wins choose the same flag. The other player should have a different flag.
3. Start melee and enter the fight
4. The player who chose to sacrifice needs to leave the match now.
5. The other players will get an insta-win. You now will return to arena mode select screen.
6. Keep entering melee and you will get your free wins. You can hold down J the entire time if you want.

Do not change flags while in this glitched state otherwise you have to do the steps above again for it to work.
