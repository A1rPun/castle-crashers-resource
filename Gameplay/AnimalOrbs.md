## <a name="bipolar"></a>Why isn't Bipolar Bear mauling?

Bipolar Bear only mauls:

- when teleports are on, which means not in cutscenes
- the player that has him equipped unless it's PvP
- when health is 11hp or below (less common with high level characters)

## <a name="bat"></a>Bitey Bat removal

1. Hold block
2. Get bitten by Bitey Bat
3. Recieve damage that can be blocked
4. Bitey Bat will disappear until you get damaged again
