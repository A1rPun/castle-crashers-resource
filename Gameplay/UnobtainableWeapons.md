## <a name="glitched"></a>Glitched sword

The infamous glitch sword was caused by sword id 0 unintentionally existing in the weapons frog.

The sword cycling through every sword type on the ground was caused by sword id 0 not having an assigned sprite, so it cycled through every sword sprite each frame.

## <a name="statless-skinny"></a>Statless Skinny Sword

This sword has id 1. Also every sword below id 0 (ex: id -1) has the appearance of the Skinny Sword.

## <a name="invis"></a>Invisible sword

Has variations like:

- Invisible Sword (most of the sword ids are this version)
- Invisible Hammer (sword id 86-92)
- Invisible Map (sword id 93)
- Invisible Horn (sword id 94)
- Invisible Arrow (sword id 95)
- Invisible Shovel (sword id 96)

2. Drop the modded weapon for the other player
3. Player who dropped the modded weapon leaves the game
4. Player that just recieved the weapon exits to map to save the weapon
5. Both players now have the modded weapon
